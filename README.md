SpotifyBinds aims to allow for custom keybind combinations to be made for spotify no matter
what you are doing, allowing you to control the current playback on your device.

# How to use
---
*Disclaimer* This requires spotify premium. There is no way around that since SpotifyBinds utilizes the spotify developer API. 

Create a spotify developer account at: https://developer.spotify.com/
Click "Create App" 
Give it a name and description. Then give it a redirect URI. A common one is this one: http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback

Now save. 

You are going to see a panel similar to this. Here, you can copy and paste your clientID and clientSecret into SpotifyBinds as well as the URI.

Now save your credentials and initialize spotify client. Then you can set your keybind combinations and click "start" to run the app.
